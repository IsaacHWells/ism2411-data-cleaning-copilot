The functions were primarily created by copilot, drawing from my previous code and the prompts I provided to it. My original code was inefficient but technically functional, but copilot made the effort to clean it up while putting into a function that I could utilize later within the python code. It would add unecessary steps or format away from the given variables, but I was able to correct it with additional prompts and my own intervention afterwards.
I did simplify some steps for copilot, but that was not the bulk of my changes to its efforts. Some variables were improperly referred to, despite my prompts pushing copilot itself to make these changes, but I ended up having to do most of this on my own in post. Some logic had to be switched out with my own if code was redundant or didn't even execute the functions afterwards. Thankfully, anything copilot did not do was simply something I could do myself without much assistance.
Data cleaning in python will always be something I intend to utilize within coding projects, given its efficient ability to format things in such a way not necessarily for readability, but function within blocks of code. Copilot can be difficult to read at times and get to do what I want, but it's a tool, not something I can expect to push the responsibility of writing code onto. It takes time getting used to, as does the entirety of GitHUb, but knowing my tools means I can work much more effectively in the future.
